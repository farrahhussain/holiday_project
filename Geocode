## ADVENTURE
# URL of the webpage to scrape
url = 'https://www.skyscanner.net/news/adventures-in-malta'

# Initialize the Selenium WebDriver (this example uses Chrome)
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=ChromeService(ChromeDriverManager().install()))

# Fetch the webpage
driver.get(url)

# Wait for the page to load completely (adjust the sleep time if necessary)
time.sleep(5)  # This wait time might need adjustment

# Get the page source after JavaScript has rendered the content
web_content = driver.page_source

# Close the driver
driver.quit()

# Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(web_content, 'html.parser')

# Find activities
headers = soup.find_all('h2', class_='wp-block-heading')

# Find descriptions
descriptions = soup.find_all('p')


# Extract the text from these headers and store them in a list
header_texts = [header.get_text() for header in headers]
activities10 = header_texts[:10]

description_texts = [description.get_text() for description in descriptions]
descriptions10 = description_texts[3:13]


# Print the list of header texts
